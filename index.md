## HTB + Vulnhub write-ups!
I like to keep my write-ups short and sweet, I encourage you to research the things I demonstrate. ```man``` the commands you aren't familiar with, look deeper into the exploits and vulnerabilities but also learn how to defend against and mitigate them. I'm only a beginner at CTF challenges so my way of doing things is likely not going to be the best solution... But it's still a solution. If you're looking for the most efficient and elegant ways to do things I suggest you take a look at different write-ups by the true professionals. This is to be treated more as a blog of mine and less as a series of ultimate guides.
